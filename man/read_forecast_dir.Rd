\title{Read forecast CSV files from a directory into a single tibble}
\usage{
read_forecast_dir(directory, recursive = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{directory}{Path to directory containing CSV files}

\item{recursive}{Whether to search subdirectories}
}
\value{
Tibble of concatenated data with a \code{file_path} column
}
\description{
This helper reads all CSV files in a directory (non-recursive by default)
and binds them into a single tibble with a \code{file_path} column.
It assumes a wide variety of forecast schemas; downstream functions should
standardize column names as needed.
}
\examples{
# forecasts <- read_forecast_dir("path/to/forecasts")
}
