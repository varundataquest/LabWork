\title{Compute CRPS from quantile forecasts (WIS-equivalent)}
\usage{
evaluate_crps_from_quantiles(
  forecasts,
  truth,
  by = c("model", "location", "target_date"),
  truth_col = "observed"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{forecasts}{Long tibble with columns: quantile (0-1), value, and grouping columns}

\item{truth}{Tibble with observed values; must contain columns in \code{by} and \code{truth_col}}

\item{by}{Character vector of grouping columns shared by forecasts and truth}

\item{truth_col}{Name of observed value column in \code{truth} (default "observed")}
}
\value{
tibble with one row per group and column: crps
}
\description{
For quantile forecasts, the WIS is a proper scoring rule that coincides with
the CRPS of a consistent piecewise-uniform distribution. This function returns
the same value as WIS for the provided quantiles.
}
\examples{
# scores <- evaluate_crps_from_quantiles(fc_long, truth_df)
}
